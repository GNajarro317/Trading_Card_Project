### Project Title
Card Prototype Webpage

### Description
In this project, I had the opportunity to demonstrate my web development skills by recreating a webpage from a design prototype. I transformed a trading card design featuring a fish into a functional webpage, replacing the fish with an animal of my choice.

### Design Specifications
The webpage includes:

* A layout resembling the provided card design.
* Italicized text for the animal’s interesting fact.
* Bolded labels for list items.
* Borders around the animal’s name, image, and information.
* Fixed card width of 300px.

### Code Quality
The HTML includes meaningful CSS class names, separates styling from content, and maintains code readability with proper indentation.
